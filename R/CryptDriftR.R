#' Simulate, analyse and plot crypt clonal data 
#'
#' A set of functions are provided to simulate neutral drift, biased drift and continuous labelling.
#' Functions are also provided to infer drift parameters from crypt count data.  
#' The models are explained in detail in "Continuous clonal labeling reveals small numbers of functional stem cells in intestinal crypts and adenomas."
